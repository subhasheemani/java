The program should settle the bills among the people and print who pays how much to whom.

Summary:
This program calculates the balances owed between a group of friends after splitting bills. The program uses a Map to keep track of each person's balance, and a List of Bills to store the details of each transaction. For each bill, the program calculates the share per person and updates the balances accordingly. Finally, the program prints the balances owed by each person. The Bill class is used to store the details of each transaction
